#Setlist Maker
Setlist maker generates a random setlist given a list of songs and an amount of time. This app is for my own band to use, but I hope to make it easy to use for any band.

##Notes for myself
This is my first repository that I plan on being active with, so these are simply some notes for myself.

git commit -m "commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/jdiggins/setlist_maker.git
git push -u origin master
